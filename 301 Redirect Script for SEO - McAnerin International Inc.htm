<h1>Redirects Using Scripting for SEOs</h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt><b>301 Redirect</b></dt>
	<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
	<dd>A function of a web server that redirects the visitor from the current 
	page or site to another page or site, while returning a response code that 
	says that the original page or site has been <b>permanently</b> moved to the 
	new location. Search engines like this information and will readily transfer 
	link popularity (and PageRank) to the new site quickly and with few issues. 
	They are also not as likely to cause issues with duplication filters. SEOs 
	like 301 redirects, and they are usually the preferred way to deal with 
	multiple domains pointing at one website.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt><b>302 Redirect</b></dt>
	<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
	<dd>A function of a web server that redirects the visitor from the current 
	page or site to another page or site, while returning a response code that 
	says that the original page or site has been <b>temporarily</b> moved to the 
	new location. Search engines will often interpret these as a park, and take 
	their time figuring out how to handle the setup. Try to avoid a 302 redirect 
	on your site if you can (unless it truly is only a temporary redirect), and 
	never use them as some form of click tracking for your outgoing links, as 
	they can result in a "website hijacking" under some circumstances.</dd>

<h2>Detailed Information</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The problem with using scripts for redirection is that search engines don't 
execute them. This means that in order for them to work they need to be executed 
on the server the when the page is called but before the search engine receives 
it. There is only one exception to this and I'll get into it in a moment.</p>
<p>In general, since the execution of the script and the redirection happens 
before the page goes to the spider, you can use any scripting language you want, 
as long as the server executes it and the language itself is capable of 
redirecting and responding with a status code like 301 or 302.</p>
<p>In general, a redirect that does not specify a 301 is treated as a 302, so in 
order to do a proper 301, you need to be able to specify the status code in the 
language of your choice. There are exceptions to this, but that's the general 
behavior.</p>
<h2>301 Redirect Script Code Examples</h2>
<h3><a name="Client_Side_Redirects">Client Side Redirects</a></h3>
<p>There are two common types of client side redirects - meta-refresh and 
JavaScript, and only meta-refresh actually works to redirect a search engine. 
However, as you are about to see, it doesn't do a very good job. In general, 
client side redirects are a bad idea and should be avoided if possible.</p>
<h4><a name="Meta_Refresh_Redirect">Meta Refresh Redirect</a> (Not The Best 
Choice)</h4>
<p>Let's start with a bad example. It's also a very, very common example, so you 
need to know about it. There is an HTML tag called the <i>meta refresh</i> that 
can do redirects that search engines can detect and react to. This is the one 
exception to the idea that client side scripts and tags don't affect search 
engines. They usually look at this one.</p>
<p>The question is, after they look at it, how do they handle it? This is a very 
important issue. For one thing, webmasters have been using this for years in 
good faith, and if a search engine fails to understand it then the result would 
be a lot of very good sites not being handled properly.</p>
<p>So a search engine needs to deal with it. Most search engines assume that a 
refresh that's faster than the time it would take the average page to load fully 
is intended act like a server redirect, whereas if the refresh is set high 
enough for the user to see it and update their bookmarks, that the intent was to 
have the user fix their bookmarks, not for the server to fix it for them. At 
this point the refresh is more of a courtesy than an instruction. Therefore 
search engines typically only worry about fast refreshes.</p>
<p>Now, they appear to treat a fast meta refresh as a 302, and life is much 
better for everyone involved. I'm not aware of any official statements on how 
they handle meta refresh, so this information comes from word-of-mouth and 
testing. Since it's handled as a 302, it's not the preferred type of redirect 
for SEO purposes.</p>
<p>Yahoo, to their immense credit, has actually outlined how they handle this. 
If a meta redirect is set to 0 seconds, then it will be treated as a 301 
redirect. If it is greater than 1 second, it's treated as a 302 redirect. 
Frankly, I consider this to be an excellent way to handle it.</p>
<p>MSN Search says "Adding a meta redirect tag to your page header does not 
remove your original page from the MSN Search index; however, it will redirect 
visitors to your new site. " I read this to mean that they treat it as a 302 
redirect. Since a 302 is considered temporary, the original page is kept in the 
index. </p>
<p>ASK apparently treats a meta-refresh of 0 as a 302, where it retrieves the 
target page in place of the source page, but keeps the source page reference 
until it figures out what is going on.</p>
<p>So basically, all 4 major search engines handle the meta-refresh differently 
- I strongly recommend NOT using it if you have any choice. If you have to, you 
are best assuming that a meta-refresh of 0 will work most consistently, and will 
probably be treated as a 302 by everyone except Yahoo, who will treat is as a 
301.</p>
<p>This goes against the "conventional wisdom" that a meta-refresh will result 
in a ban or penalty. Not true. It will result in a 302 - which may look like a 
penalty under some circumstances. 302's can be bad news since the target content 
is treated as belonging to the source page, which can result in hijacks, 
duplication issues, and numerous other problems.</p>
<p>I don't recommend it, but it can work as a method of last resort. <i>Caveat 
Emptor</i>.</p>
<h4>Meta Refresh Example (Not The Best Choice)</h4>
<p class="code">&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0; 
URL=http://www.newdomain.com"&gt;</p>
<h4>JavaScript Redirect (Not Recommended At All)</h4>
<p>JavaScript is the second type of common client side redirect. Unlike the 
meta-refresh tag, <b>a search engine will ignore a JavaScript redirect and stay 
on the page.</b></p>
<p>Some people have decided that they could use this behavior to spam the search 
engines, by stuffing keywords on a page and then using a fast JavaScript 
redirect to move people on to the next page while allowing the spider to stay 
and index the spam page.</p>
<p>Google figured out how to detect this tactic in the summer of 2004 and as a 
result a LOT of websites lost rankings, resulting in at least one infamous SEO 
firm getting a class action lawsuit started against them, as well as making them 
look really bad.</p>
<p>In short, JavaScript redirects do not work for search engines, and using them 
can possibly get you banned from a search engine, depending on the 
circumstances.</p>
<p><b>Never use a JavaScript redirect on a page or domain you want to rank with 
search engines.</b></p>
<p>The only reason I included them on this page is to serve as a warning. There 
are some times you could use them on pages that are not search engine 
accessible, such as certain shopping cart systems and so forth, but in general, 
you are best off avoiding them.</p>
<h4>Javascript Redirect Example (Not Recommended)</h4>
<p class="code">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
&lt;!--<br>
window.location = "http://www.newdomain.com/"<br>
//--&gt;<br>
&lt;/script&gt; </p>
<p><b>or</b></p>
<p class="code"><code>&lt;body onLoad="setTimeout(location.href='http://xxx', '0')" 
&gt;</code></p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>I cannot stress enough that this method is NOT 
recommended.</b></font></p>
<p>It has the net effect of showing humans and search engines 2 different things 
- not a good start to long term results. Basically, it's risky.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Server-Side_Redirects">Server-Side Redirects</a></h3>
<p>Servers do not automatically go though every webpage they serve out and look 
for scripts to run. They only look inside files that they know may have server 
side scripting in them. This saves overhead for the server, and is more 
efficient. Traditionally, files ending in .htm and .html are considered static 
and therefore most servers will not attempt to execute them. You can force them 
to be recognized as dynamic, but in general this is not done.</p>
<p>When a dynamic page is called from a server, the server looks in the page 
first, before sending it to the user. It will then execute all the scripts it 
recognises as scripts it should execute, then sends the <b>results</b> to the 
user. This means that a dynamic page can look very different on the server than 
it does when it finally reaches the user. It's common for certain CMS systems to 
only have one page in them, and that page's content is controlled by the 
variables sent to it. This is one of the reasons why search engines will 
distrust pages with a lot of variables.</p>
<p>In order to execute a server side script, the server must be set to process 
the page type it's on, and the script must be present on the page (usually in 
the header or at the very top of the page)</p><hr>
<h4>PHP 301 Redirect Example</h4>
<p class="code">header("HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently");<br>
header("Location: http://www.newdomain.com/newdir/newpage.htm");<br>
exit();</p>
<hr>
<h4>ASP 301 Redirect Example (VBScript)<br>
&nbsp;</h4>
<p class="code">&lt;%@ Language=VBScript %&gt;<br>
&lt;%<br>
Response.Status="301 Moved Permanently" <br>
Response.AddHeader "Location", "http://www.newdomain.com/newdir/newpage.asp"<br>
response.end<br>
%&gt;</p>
<h4>ASP 301 Redirect Example (JScript)</h4>
<p class="code">function PermanentRedirect(strDestinationUri) {<br>
Response.Clear();<br>
Response.Status = 301;<br>
Response.AddHeader("Location", strDestinationUri);<br>
Response.Flush();<br>
Response.End();<br>
}</p>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>“strDestinationUri” should be an absolute URI for maximum client 
compatibility. The function assumes that “Response.Buffer = true;” has been set 
at some point prior to invoking the function and will error if hasn't (this is 
the default configuration for IIS5 and above). </p>
<hr>
<h4>ASP .NET 301 Redirect Example&nbsp; (C#)</h4>
<p class="code">&lt;script runat="server"&gt;<br>
private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)<br>
{<br>
Response.Status = "301 Moved Permanently";<br>
Response.AddHeader("Location","http://www.new-url.com/");<br>
}<br>
&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<hr>
<h4>Cold Fusion 301 Redirect Example (CFM)</h4>
<p>Simply add this code to your ColdFusion page:</p>
<p class="code">&lt;.cfheader statuscode="301" statustext="Moved permanently"&gt;<br>
&lt;.cfheader name="Location" value="http://www.new-url.com/"&gt;</p>
<hr>
<h4>JSP / JAVA 301 Redirect Example</h4>
<p>Simply add this code to your page or script:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">&lt;%<br>
response.setStatus(301);<br>
response.setHeader( "Location", "http://www.new-url.com/" );<br>
response.setHeader( "Connection", "close" );<br>
%&gt;</p><hr>
<h4>CGI / Perl 301 Redirect Example Code</h4>
<p><b>Perl is different from the above examples because it doesn't go on a page 
at all.</b> It's actually a script that is called (usually from the cgi-bin). 
"Pages" typically look like "pages.cgi" and are called as if they were scripts, 
not web pages.</p>
<p class="code">#! /usr/bin/perl<br>
use cgi; <br>
my $q = cgi-&gt;new(); <br>
print $q-&gt;redirect( <br>
-location =&gt; 'http://www.newsite.com/newpage.cgi', <br>
-status =&gt; 301, <br>
);</p>
<hr>
<h3>Processing Static Pages as if they were Dynamic</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will want to do redirects on pages that are standard static web 
pages (ie htm or html). This is especially common when you are trying to switch 
from an old static system to a newer dynamic one. The problem is that since 
search engines don't execute scripts, redirection scripts won't work for a 
search engine in a static page. What to do?</p>
<p>Well, there is a fix. More like a kludge. But it works. What you do is tell 
the webserver that pages with the extension .htm (and/ or .html) are actually 
dynamic and should be treated as if they were dynamic pages. This will slightly 
increase the load on your server (since all .htm pages will be processed before 
being rendered) but it's very slight and you probably won't notice it.</p>
<p>It would be no different of a load than if you just switched all your pages 
over to dynamic anyway.
</p>
<h4>Processing .html Pages as if they were .php in Apache</h4>
<p>You can force all *.htm pages to be parsed by the php interpreter with an 
.htaccess directive:</p>
<p class="code">AddType application/x-httpd-php .html</p>
<p>Make appropriate adjustments if it's *.htm documents you want processed:</p>
<p class="code">AddType application/x-httpd-php .htm</p>
<h4>Processing .htm Pages as if they were .asp in IIS</h4>
<p>In the Internet Services Manager, go to the "Home Directory" tab of your 
website properties and click the "Configuration" button. On the "App Mappings" 
tab of that pop-up, you can control how files are processed. You want to set up 
a new mapping for the HTM extension that looks just like the ASP mapping. You 
can also do this for HTML files, if you use them.</p>
<p>Some systems are set up differently from mine - just look at whatever the 
settings are for your ASP pages and duplicate them for HTM pages.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Scripting redirection can accomplish a lot, and if it's server-side you are 
usually pretty safe regarding search engines following it. In general, it takes 
less overhead and is easier to use webserver redirection using either
<a href="http://www.mcanerin.com/en/articles/301-redirect-apache.asp">Apache</a> or <a href="http://www.mcanerin.com/en/articles/301-redirect-IIS.asp">
IIS</a>. However, redirection with scripting is a legitimate technique for 
people without full control over their server, or who have some very specific 
scenarios requiring redirection that are not supported by the webserver 
directly.</p>
